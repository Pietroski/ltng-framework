# Server distribution.

We have worked a great deal on the server and we need to distribute it to the client.

## Requirements

- The server should be distributed to the client.
- The server should be able to run on the client.
- We need to bundle and minify the server so the developer can copy and paste it to its project to be able to start it's own FE server or it there another way we can make our scripts portable to the developers?
