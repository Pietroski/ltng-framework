# Distribution

We have achieved great deal and progress with this Ltng-Framework so far! Nicely done!
However, on good and important part is its distribution.

Developers commonly use npm, yarn, pnpm or other to distribute javascript/typescript packages.
A few developers. distribute their libraries as a minified.js file over a simple http call from a static page website, such as HTMLX and others. One way of achieving that is via github raw pages.
However, we don't have a minified / pre-compiled version of our library. How could we achieve that? Do we need to build our own javascript minifier if we do not want to use any external dependencies or can we resort to any other tools that could possibly help us with?

What are our alternatives?

Would you know how to minify a javascript code? But if you do it it would not be human maintainable, which is the purpose of programming languages the way they are!

What can we do to make sure our code is easily distributed without any package manager?
