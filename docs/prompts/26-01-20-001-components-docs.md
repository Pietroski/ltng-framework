ltng-framework/ltng-components/README.md I believe that that documentation has issues for how to use most if not all the components. 

I need help setting up an stretegy to fix this. So we come up wuth a better very well detailed of how to use each component with working examples and best practices.

Let's start with the [COMPONENT] component.
`ltng-framework/ltng-components/[COMPONENT]`

For dealing with context, refer to the `ltng-framework/docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md` file.

To understand better the base framework, refer to the `ltng-framework/docs/Design Overview.md` file.
