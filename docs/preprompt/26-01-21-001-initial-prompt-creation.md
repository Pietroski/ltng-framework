I now need help in writing a prompt so I can handle to an LLM so he can decide when it is the best time to use the ltng-framewor, ltng-components, ltng-tools and ltng-testingtools unless specified to use a specific one.
I need a good prompt so the LLM can make the best decision based on the given task and also be able to use the tools and frameworks correctly when needed.
