# Prompt

For an efficient Artificial Inteligence Driven Project (AIDP) a good prompt is a must have.

I ususally come with an approach where I would write a very details (or at least as much as possible) .md file document with all the requirements, details and specifications for the project and than I'll elaborate a prompt to be used as a pre-prompt for the AI to understand the project and the requirements.

The current pre-prompts I have been using are the followings:

```prompt
As a software engineer, I need help implement the new project requirements that are under docs/requirements/yy-mm-dd_xxx-requirements.md 
```

```prompt
As a software enginner, I need help into developing the next feature for this project. The specifications, description and requirements are under docs/requirements/25-12-02_005-requirements.md file. Let me know if you have any questions or if you would prefere to draw a proposal up first (for proposals docs/proposals/xxx-<proposal-title>.md).
```
