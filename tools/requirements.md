# Tools

I have, in the past, written a few JS-TS libraries to use in my projects.

However, they were written in typescript and I am creating a vanilla javascript framework, so I need to rewrite them in vanilla javascript.
I know there are a few runtimes like bun that can read and execute typescript on the fly without any compilation to javascript. But let's leave that aside for now and let's only focus onto re-writing those libraries I wrote in here, in vanilla javascript. the libraries should be written under tools/<name-of-the-libtool>.
Also, I want to have unit tests written for every and each one of them as most of the code in the old/original library.
